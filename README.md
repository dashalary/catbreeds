## CatBreeds

Welcome to CatBreeds! CatBreeds is an interactive CLI app that allows users to view a list of domestic cat breeds and see additional information about the breed of their choosing. It uses HTTParty to retrieve data from an existing API, TheCatApi, and makes new instances of Ruby objects/classes to represent that data to users.
