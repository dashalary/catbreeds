# Catbreeds

Welcome to CatBreeds! CatBreeds is an interactive CLI app that allows users to view a list of domestic cat breeds and see additional information about the breed of their choosing. It uses HTTParty to retrieve data from an existing API, TheCatApi, and makes new instances of Ruby objects/classes to represent that data to users.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'catbreeds'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install catbreeds
